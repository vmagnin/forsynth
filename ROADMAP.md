# Roadmap

## ForSynth 0.3 "Ã‰liane Radigue"

### Development
* [x] Start an OOP approach.

### Features
* [x] A `music_common` module could gather the common code and parameters of ForMIDI and ForSynth.
* [x] Add other chords: 7th, Sus2, Sus4... using the `music_common` module.
* [x] The duration (120 seconds by default) and number of tracks should be set when we create a new WAV, instead of being hard-set.
* [x] The method `mix_tracks()` could accept an optional array with the final levels of each track.

### Examples
* [ ] Improve the artistic quality of some examples.

### Documentation
* [x] Design a logo.


## ForSynth 0.4 "?????"

### Development
* [ ] More OOP.

### Features
* [ ] in `src/envelopes.f90`:
    * [ ] The ADSR parameter of the envelope should be passed as arguments.
    * [ ] Add `fade_in()` and `fade_out()` functions or subroutines.

### Examples
* [ ] More examples.
* [ ] Add comments to document the usage of the API.


## Ideas for further developments

* [ ] Add more [audio effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Audio_effects)
    * [ ] A function reverse() (or backward)
    * [ ] Compressor
    * [ ] [Flanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanging)
    * [ ] [Phaser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaser_(effect))
    * [ ] [Chorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorus_(audio_effect))

* [ ] Examples
    * [ ] Simulate Doppler effect
        * [ ] Could be used to obtain a Leslie speaker effect?
    * [ ] Synthesis: a bell
    * [ ] Drone music

* [ ] `mix_tracks()` could accept an optional array with panoramic settings.

* [ ] Physical modelling
    * [ ] Using https://gitlab.com/certik/stringsim ?

* [ ] Soustractive synthesis: add filters (FFT?)

* [ ] Major and minor brokken chords routines. Would use Karplus-Strong algorithm, 
    * [ ] but that algorithm should be modified to not delete what is already present on the track.

* [ ] A drum pattern object to ease programming rhythms. Could be also used by ForMIDI.
* [ ] A sequence object, accepting a string with notes, with methods to obtain one by one their parameters (physical or MIDI). Could be also used by ForMIDI.
    * [ ] The sequence could for example be coded as "A4,Q.,pf;A#4,Q,pf;..." (note, length, intensity).

* [ ] Scientific data sonification: by reading a data file? or by passing an array?
