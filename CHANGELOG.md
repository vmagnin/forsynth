## [Forsynth development version "Ã‰liane Radigue"] 2024

### Added
- The method `mix_tracks()` is now public and accepts an optional array containing the levels of each track (except track 0) in the mix.
- music module:
    - A subroutine `add_chord()`, using an array containing the intervals of the chord.
    - A function `fr()` to compute the frequency of a note, for example "A#3".
    - Several music scales stored in arrays.
- `signals.f90` module:
    - a new fractal `add_weierstrass()` signal.
    - `add_karplus_strong_drum()` signal.
    - `add_karplus_strong_drum_stretched()`.
    - `karplus_strong_stretched()`
- demos module:
    - Added some scales in `demo3()`.
    - `drum_machine.f90` using Karplus Strong drums, following a pattern defined in an array.
    - `misc_sounds.f90`: creates miscellaneous sounds in WAV files, especially obtained by frequency or phase modulation.
- A `ROADMAP.md` file.
- A `logo`.
- A `example/README.md` file.

### Changed
- `src/forsynth.f90`:
    - the class `file_t` was renamed `WAV_file` and put in a separate file `wav_file_class.f90`. `close_WAV_file()`, `write_header()` and `write_normalized_data()` are now methods of the object.
    - a class `tape_recorder` was created and moved to `tape_recorder_class.f90`. It contains the arrays and their related parameters, and the methods `clear_tracks`, `mix_tracks`, `copy_section`...
- `clear_tracks()` is now automatically called when creating a `wav_file` or `tape_recorder` object.
- `src/music.f90` was splitted in two files: `src/music.f90` and `src/music_common.f90` which contain music theory elements common to the ForMIDI and ForSynth projects.
- `src/demos.f90` was removed and split into `example/demo1.f90`, `example/demo2.f90` and `example/demo3.f90`. They can be run with the `fpm run --example` command.
    - `example/demo3.f90` was split in two: demo3 (two scales and a blues) and demo4 (signals).
        - and demo3 renamed `blues.f90` and improved.
    - `demo1` was renamed `chords_and_melody`.
    - `demo2` was renamed `demo_effects`.
- `demo4.f90` renamed `signals.f90`.
- Now under GPL-3.0-or-later license.

### Removed
- `app/main.f90` was removed. The `test_the_machine()` subroutine is now called by `fpm test`.
- The routines `add_major_chord()` and `add_minor_chord()` in the `music` module (replaced by `add_chord()`).

### Fixed
- A bug in `add_karplus_strong()`.


## [Forsynth 0.2 "Daft Punk"] 2021-02-23

### Added
- forsynth module:
  - `copy_section()`
  - `clear_tracks()`
- music module:
  - `add_note()` to generate a note with a sum of harmonics.
  - `add_major_chord()`
  - `add_minor_chord()`
- demos module:
  - `demo1()`
  - `demo2()`
  - `demo3()`
- envelopes module: `ADSR_envelope()` function
- signals module:
  - `add_karplus_strong()` for plucked strings
  - `add_square_wave()`
  - `add_sawtooth_wave()`
  - `add_triangle_wave()`
  - `add_noise()`
- sound_effects module:
  - `apply_delay_effect()`
  - `apply_fuzz_effect()`
  - `apply_tremolo_effect()`
  - `apply_autopan_effect()`

### Changed
- `add_sinusoidal_signal` has been renamed `add_sine_wave`, on the same model
as the other waveforms.
